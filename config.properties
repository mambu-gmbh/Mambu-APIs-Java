# Configuration file for Java API Wrapper SDK 
#
#
# Defines the Application Key (for Mambu Environments which require this key for API access) and the Demo data IDs and Demo entities to be used for testing
#
# APPLICATION_KEY settings
# Remove or comment out this parameter for environments with no APPLICATION_KEY requirement (e.g. sandbox)
# Specify the Application Key in the following format:  APPLICATION_KEY = xyz12344abcd
# Replace the value with your Application Key 
#APPLICATION_KEY = xyz12344abcd
#
#
#  Demo Data: 
#  Specifies the IDs of the entities to be used for Demo tests.
#  Example: demoUsername = myTestUsername
#  Comment out or leave the corresponding parameter blank to use a randomly selected entity

#  For Loan Product ID and Savings Product ID the corresponding ID can also be set to ALL_TYPES. 
#  In this case, Demo tests for LoanService and SavingsService would be executing all test cases once for EACH of the product types (if there are active products of this type defined)
#  Example:  demoLaonProductId = ALL_TYPES and/or demoSavingsProductId = ALL_TYPES
